        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, 
            every home cook needs a good buttermilk pancake 
            recipe in their repertoire. Don't have a tried-and-true 
            favorite yet? You're in luck! The Allrecipes community 
            can't get enough of these classic buttermilk pancakes. 
            Reviewers say they're light, fluffy, moist, and full 
            of rich flavor. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong></li>
            <p>All-purpose flour contains gluten, 
                which gives the buttermilk pancakes 
                structure and pleasant chewiness.</p>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong></li>
            <p>Just three tablespoons of white sugar 
                should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. 
                Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar 
                if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</p>
            <li><strong>Leaveners</strong></li>
            <p>Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners 
                (a substance that releases gas when mixed with 
                other ingredients, causing the batter to rise 
                to fluffy perfection).</p>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
            <p>You definitely don't want to skip adding a small 
                amount of salt — the buttermilk pancakes will 
                taste bland without it. </p>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong></li>
            <p>Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk 
                pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups. </p>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong></li>
            <p>Whole milk helps create the perfect batter 
                consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's 
                acidity.</p>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
            <p>Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor 
                to the buttermilk pancakes.</p>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong></li>
            <p>Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes 
                nice and moist. </p>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to make them?</h2>
        <p>It's really quite easy to make perfect buttermilk 
            pancakes at home. You'll find the full, step-by-step 
            recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what 
            to expect:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Mix Dry Ingredients</h3></li>
            <p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, 
                baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. </p>
            <li><h3>Mix Wet Ingredients</h3></li>
            <p>Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted 
                butter together in a separate bowl. Do not 
                combine the wet and dry ingredients until 
                right before you cook the pancakes. </p>
            <li><h3>Make the Pancakes</h3></li>
            <p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients 
                and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the 
                mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter 
                onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the 
                pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula 
                and cook until both sides are brown.  </p>
        </ol>
