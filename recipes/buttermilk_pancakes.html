    <div class="section">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Flour</strong>
                <p>
                    All-purpose flour contains gluten,
                    which gives the buttermilk pancakes
                    structure and pleasant chewiness.
                </p>
            </li>
            
    
            <li>
                <strong>Sugar</strong>
                <p>Just three tablespoons of white sugar
                    should be enough to lend subtle sweetness.
                    Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar
                    if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</p>
        
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Leaveners</strong>
                <p>
                    Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners
                    (a substance that releases gas when mixed with
                    other ingredients, causing the batter to rise
                    to fluffy perfection).
                </p>
            </li>
            
    
            <li>
                <strong>Salt</strong>
                <p>
                    You definitely don't want to skip adding a small
                    amount of salt â€” the buttermilk pancakes will
                    taste bland without it.
                </p>
        
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Buttermilk</strong>
                <p>
                    Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk
                    pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups.
                </p>
            </li>
           
    
            <li>
                <strong>Milk</strong>
                <p>
                    Whole milk helps create the perfect batter
                    consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's
                    acidity.
                </p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Eggs</strong>
                <p>Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor
                    to the buttermilk pancakes.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Butter</strong>
                <p>Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes
                    nice and moist. </p>
            </li>   
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <p>It's really quite easy to make perfect buttermilk
            pancakes at home. You'll find the full, step-by-step
            recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what
            to expect:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
                <p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder,
                    baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h3>Mix Wet Ingredients</h3>
                <p>Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted
                    butter together in a separate bowl. Do not
                    combine the wet and dry ingredients until
                    right before you cook the pancakes. </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h3>Make the Pancakes</h3>
                <p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients
                    and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the
                    mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter
                    onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the
                    pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula
                    and cook until both sides are brown. </p>
            </li>
